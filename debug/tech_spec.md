## Technical Specification

### Caching Implementation

After reviewing the current system performance, we propose implementing a Redis-based caching solution. This will address the memory usage issues we're currently experiencing.

Implementation details:
1. Set up Redis instance
2. Implement cache wrapper
3. Add cache invalidation strategy
4. Monitor memory usage
