## Project Meeting Notes

We need to implement a new caching system for the application. The current implementation is too slow and uses too much memory. We should consider using Redis as a caching layer.

Key points:
- Current system is inefficient
- Redis would provide better performance
- Need to implement proper cache invalidation
